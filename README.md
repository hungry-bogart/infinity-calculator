## Description 

The infinity calculator is a reverse engineering challenge. This simple calculator allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations. 

The challenge is to find the flag hidden in the calculator code. This is the first complete challenge I've written in C++, so I hope you enjoy it!

## Solution

There are three things you can do to solve this challenge:

1. Try to guess based on context clues.

2. Use basic reversing tools to get the flag. Things like strings, hexdump, and radare2.

3. I will add a writeup at the end of the month to mark the end of the challenge. (August 31st, 2025)
